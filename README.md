# üèè Cricket Analysis & Playing XI Selection ‚Äì Power BI Dashboard
üìå Overview

This project is a data-driven cricket analysis tool built in Power BI with the primary goal of selecting the optimal Playing XI for T20 cricket matches.
It uses real-world cricket statistics scraped from ESPN Cricinfo to provide actionable insights for selectors, analysts, fantasy team players, and cricket enthusiasts.

üìÇ Data Collection
Source

Data was collected from the ESPN Cricinfo website, which hosts comprehensive cricket match and player statistics.
Scraping Scripts

Three JavaScript-based scraping scripts were created to collect the necessary datasets:

    t20_wc_batting_summary.js

        Extracts batting statistics for all players in T20 World Cup matches.

        Fields collected: Player Name, Matches, Innings, Runs, Average, Strike Rate, 50s, 100s, etc.

    t20_wc_bowling_summary.js

        Extracts bowling statistics.

        Fields collected: Player Name, Matches, Overs, Wickets, Average, Economy, Best Figures, etc.

    t20_wc_match_results.js

        Scrapes match-level data including team scores, winners, and match conditions.

        Useful for analyzing performance against specific teams and in specific venues.

These scripts were run in a browser console on the respective ESPN Cricinfo stats pages, and the extracted data was saved as CSV/Excel files for Power BI processing.
üîÑ Data Processing & Transformation

    Imported raw CSV files into Power BI Desktop.

    Performed data cleaning:

        Removed duplicates.

        Standardized player names across datasets.

        Converted text fields to numeric types where applicable.

    Created relationships between datasets (Batting ‚Üî Bowling ‚Üî Match Results).

    Used DAX for calculated columns and measures, e.g.:

        Batting Impact Score

        Bowling Efficiency Index

        All-rounder Value
